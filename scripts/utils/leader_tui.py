#TODO - Leaderboard for following personal and the big leaderboards.  

#Have it store session data in a configs.json.  That way we don't overrequest for the data.  

#Things I'd want to track.  
#Private Leaderboards
#Public Leaderboards - Possibly some fun stats there. 
#Overall stars compared to previous years as each day progresses.
    #Will need a separate storage and a func to grab previous star counts
