## üéÑ Advent of Code 2024 üéÑ

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges. Huge thanks to [anze3db](https://github.com/anze3db) for his excellent [AOC](https://github.com/anze3db/adventofcode/tree/main) python framework. I borrowed alot of his code in the effort to create a more streamlined AOC experience for myself.  Thank you!


### Setup TODO 

First export your cookie session with AOC with the google chrome developer tools  (Literally just go copy it)
Then make a folder in your root titled `secret` and create a text file within called `cookie.txt`.  
The .gitignore will ignore all text files / (and other formats) so it won't get loaded into github.

#### For next year

- [ ] Make a function that captures the output and updates the results table in the README. SORCERY :mage: :magic_wand: 
- [ ] Make a TUI to view and navigate the leaderboard.
    - It looks like you can request a Json payload every 15 minutes (900 seconds) for public and private leaderboards.  Could write to a JSON configs file in utils with last timestamp accessed. easier to maintain that way. Not sure cacheing would help here as we would want immediate leaderboard updates.
